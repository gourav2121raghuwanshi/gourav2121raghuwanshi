## Hi there üëã

Hi, I'm **Gourav Raghuwanshi**, currently pursuing a B.Tech in CSE.  
I have a strong foundation in **Web Development** and **Artificial Intelligence**, and I enjoy building scalable, intelligent applications.  
I‚Äôve worked on projects ranging from **full-stack web apps** using React.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, and MongoDB, to **AI-driven platforms** integrating LLMs, RAG, and multimodal inputs.  

Some highlights of my work include:    
- üåê Building **FindYourHome**, an AI-powered real estate platform with ML-based property price prediction, Generative AI‚Äìdriven search assistance, a dynamic React.js frontend, Redux Toolkit, and secure backend integration.  
- üõí AI-Kart ‚Äì A marketplace for AI apps enabling users to build, publish, and monetize custom AI solutions using Google Gemini, LLMs, and vector embeddings.

Outside of coding, I love solving **competitive programming challenges** on LeetCode and Codeforces, which sharpen my problem-solving skills.  
I‚Äôm passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to **real-world impactful solutions**.  

- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on **innovative projects in Web Development and AI**.
